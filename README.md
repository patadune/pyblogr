pyblogr
=======

Python blog engine, inspired by Tumblr, powered by Flask.

Testing
-------

- Install Flask and dependencies using pip :

        pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run flask using builtin-webserver :

        python runserver.py

Now you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and start using the blog.     
By default, it will start in debug mode, and if you try to login, you will be automatically logged as DEBUG user.

Installation
------------

One day !

TODO
----

- Proper installer
- File uploads
- Code refactoring
- Login and password hash should be stored in config file
- ORM integration (using Peewee)
